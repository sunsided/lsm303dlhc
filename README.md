# `lsm303dlhc`

> A platform-agnostic driver to interface with the (now discontinued) LSM303DLHC (accelerometer + compass)

Uses [`lsm303dlhc-registers`](https://crates.io/crates/lsm303dlhc-registers) for typed register access
with [`hardware-registers`](https://crates.io/crates/hardware-registers) traits.

## What works

- Reading the accelerometer
- Reading the compass and temperature sensor
- Direct access to interesting
